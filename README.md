# ***Sound-of-the-string***
First  project for Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Software Development

View the "{Sound of the strings]( https://veridario.github.io/Sound-of-the-string/)" website here on GitHub Pages.

##Technologies Used

In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 to build the project, we wrote our code using the Cloud9 IDE, and we've backed it up using Git and GitHub

The Sound of the Strings website page is a landing page intended to reach all the people that want to learn how to play a string musical instrument. It offers in presence free courses in the middle of Dublin City Center. The courses are suitable for people of every age. The users of the website are able to find all the information they need about the locations, timetables, type of string instrument and sign up form. In the Home, under the Our Story section, they can learn more about the idea which gave birth to the Music Academy.

## ***Features***

1.	The Navigation links are to the right side of the page. Users can click on the Home, Gallery, and Sign up button. Each button links to the correspondent section of the website.
2.	The Navigation buttons Font and code change the size of the characters once you point the mouse on them. This is very user-friendly because the user knows exactly where the mouse is pointing and clicking, especially for people having troubles in reading.
